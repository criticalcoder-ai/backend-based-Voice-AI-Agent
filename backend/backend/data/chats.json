This means you'll pay separately for gas, electric, and water.

Also, the landlord allows pets and smoking, so it might be a bit less quiet than you'd prefer. But hey, it's perfectly on budget!\n* **Property ID:** [Property 9d82621e-74a8-43fa-bde9-91e966c779cc]\n\n\nSo, what do you think? Any questions about either of these?

It's only 5 minutes from a Green Line stop and about 20 minutes from Northeastern.  Rent is $1100 a month, which is under budget!  It has in-unit laundry, which is a bonus.  The downside? Utilities aren't included, so your total monthly cost will be a little higher.\n\nThe second place, [Property 9d82621e-74a8-43fa-bde9-91e966c779cc], is a 1-bedroom on Huntington Avenue. It's right at your $1300 budget.  Big plus: pets and smoking are allowed!  The trade-off? It might be a bit further from Northeastern than the other option.\n\nLet me know what you think!

Here's the option I found that's pretty close to your ideal situation:\n\n**93A Hillside Street**\n\n* **Nickname:** Hillside Haven\n* **Location:** A bit further from Northeastern than you ideally wanted (about 20 minutes away by public transit, according to Google Maps). Still very accessible via the Green Line.\n* **Price:** $1100/month (Yay, under budget!)\n* **Move-in:** June (perfect!)\n* **Key Features:** 4 rooms (might be more space than you need!), in-unit laundry.\n\n**The Trade-off:**  It's a bit further from Northeastern than you initially wanted, and it's a 4-room apartment, which might be more space than you need. However, it's significantly under your budget, and it has in-unit laundry, which is a nice plus!  Plus, being a bit further from campus might mean a quieter neighborhood.  What do you think?  Does this sound like something you might be interested in seeing in person, or should we broaden our search parameters a bit?\n",

Want the good news first? \ud83d\ude09\n\nThe first one is super close to Northeastern, but it's slightly over your budget and doesn't have in-unit laundry.  It's also a 4-bedroom, so you'd be sharing with roommates.  It's a great location though!\n\n* **Name:**  Hillside Haven near Northeastern\n* **Location:** 93A Hillside Street (5 mins from Green Line, 20 mins from Northeastern)\n* **Price:** $1100/month (No utilities included \u2013 keep that in mind!)\n* **Move-in:** June\n* **Key Features:** 4 rooms, close to transit and Northeastern.\n* **Trade-offs:**  Slightly smaller than a 1-bedroom (shared space), no in-unit laundry, and utilities are extra.  But the location is fantastic for getting to school!\n* **Property ID:** [Property 6ee23665-b89c-4852-96ef-b7568d91a08e]\n\n\nThe second option is a 1-bedroom, but it's a bit further from Northeastern.

Rent is $1100 a month (yay!), but utilities aren't included.  It's got in-unit laundry, which is a plus! No pets allowed, though. [Property 6ee23665-b89c-4852-96ef-b7568d91a08e]\n\n\nThe second option is \"Huntington Home\". It's a 1-bedroom apartment on Huntington Avenue, right in the heart of things. Rent is $1300 a month, which is right on budget.  The best part? It's pet-friendly and smoking is allowed! [Property 9d82621e-74a8-43fa-bde9-91e966c779cc]\n\n\nSo, Hillside Haven is cheaper but a bit further from Northeastern and you'll have to pay utilities separately.
